# ‚öôÔ∏è Digital Logic Accelerator (RTL to GDSII)

A high-performance, Verilog-based hardware accelerator designed to efficiently execute core digital logic operations using FPGA and ASIC design methodologies. This project was implemented as part of the 21ECP302L ‚Äì Project course under the Department of ECE, SRM Institute of Science and Technology.

## üß† Project Overview

The **Digital Logic Accelerator (DLA)** offloads compute-intensive logic operations like AND, OR, XOR, and NAND from the CPU to specialized reconfigurable hardware. Designed with modularity and pipelined parallelism, it provides ultra-fast performance in real-time systems like AI inference, cryptography, and embedded edge computing.

- RTL designed using Verilog
- FPGA synthesis via Xilinx Vivado 2023.2
- ASIC flow verified via Synopsys DC & ICC II using SAED 32nm PDK
- Modular and pipelined architecture
- Support for runtime logic reconfiguration
